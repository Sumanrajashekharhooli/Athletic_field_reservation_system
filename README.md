Athletic Field Reservation System
Project Overview
The Athletic Field Reservation System is a web-based application designed to streamline the reservation process for athletic fields. This system allows users to easily check the availability of fields, make reservations, and manage bookings efficiently. The project aims to improve the overall user experience for athletes, coaches, and sports administrators.

Problem Statement
Athletic field reservations are often managed manually, leading to confusion, double bookings, and a lack of accessibility for users. This project addresses these issues by providing a centralized platform where users can:

View real-time availability of athletic fields.
Make reservations online without the need for manual intervention.
Receive notifications and reminders for upcoming reservations.
Cancel or modify bookings easily.
By implementing this system, we aim to enhance the organization and management of athletic facilities, ensuring a smooth experience for all users.
